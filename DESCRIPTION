Package: MetaboCoreUtils
Title: Core Utils for Metabolomics Data
Version: 1.13.1
Description: MetaboCoreUtils defines metabolomics-related core functionality
    provided as low-level functions to allow a data structure-independent usage
    across various R packages. This includes functions to calculate between ion
    (adduct) and compound mass-to-charge ratios and masses or functions to work
    with chemical formulas. The package provides also a set of adduct
    definitions and information on some commercially available internal
    standard mixes commonly used in MS experiments.
